# react

> ReactDOM makes this UI visible in the browser.
> 在浏览器中 reactDom 渲染 UI
> React Native makes this UI visible in a native app.
> It's important to remember that the React library has nothing to do with a web browser:
> 记住 React 跟 web 浏览器没有关联，这很重要
> ReactDOM binds the idea of React to a web browser (example: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.).
> Whereas React Native binds the idea of React to a native app (example: native android, native iOS).
